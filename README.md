## **The** ***cutest*** **SparxMaths bookwork-bypass extension for Chromium ~!**

### ✩ *If you like this project, consider giving it a star!* ✩

<img src="extension/assets/divider.png">

### ♡ **How to install:**

- Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/releases/) > **[Latest](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/releases/latest)** or click on **[Azalea.zip](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/releases/latest/download/Azalea.zip)** to download the **compressed extension bundle** containing all the things to be injected into Sparx!
    <hr />
- Extract the ZIP to a folder onto your local file system.
- Open the **Manage Extensions** tab in your Chromium-based browser
  - (This can be any browser ranging from `Chrome` to `Edge` to `Opera` to `Arc`).
  <hr />
- *(Enable* ***Developer Mode*** *if not enabled already.)*
- Click on **Load Unpacked**.
- Select the **Azalea-(version)** directory.
  <hr />
- **You're done!** Open/Refresh `Sparx` the extension should be installed! :D

### ♡ **Features provided by the extension:**

- Adds a simple CSS property which **allows all text to be selectable**:

    ```css
    :root {
        --user-select-accessibility-setting: default !important;
    }
    ```

- Provides access to **Themes** by going into **Menu > Themes** at the top right!
  - Currently the **themes available** include:
  - Pink (Default ✓), Purple, Blue, Aqua, Green, Creme, Custom
    <hr />
  - *Note:* ***Custom themes allow you to theme every colored variable available in Azalea, ranging from tints to regular colors to text colors. This uses the colors for `Pink` by default because I advocate for pink and believe it is the best color <3.***
  <hr />

- Stores **bookwork checks** and automatically submits them if possible (this is *on* by default, and can be disabled from **Menu > Settings**), otherwise shows you the answer to choose the correct option yourself.

  <hr />

- Allows you to anonymize your username by setting it to **Rosie :3** by default (editable from **Menu > Settings**, off by default). This aims to make Sparx a place where you cannot be doxxed by showing a screenshot asking for help!

### ♡ **Notes on bundling:**

- The codebase **is minified into a bundle**, but this is simply done to reduce file size when installing. This means that **all of the source code is public** and the codebase is transformed into a bundle using GitHub Actions, available to view [here](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/actions).

    <hr />

- This ensures that the code is safe to use for everyone! If you don't trust me, the actions, or want to be extra sure, *which is perfectly fair enough*, **clone the repository and build the extension yourself**!

    <hr />

- At the moment, **there is no updater implementation in the extension**, so you will need to reinstall the extension manually from here when updates arrive. When this does eventually release, it will be **opt-in only**, which means it will be **disabled by default**, to ensure safety.
